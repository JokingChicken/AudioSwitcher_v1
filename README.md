JokingChicken:

	Added:
	- I changed the functionality so that the hotkeys are able to be toggable between two devices
	- ensured to only make one instance of the program on startup
	- add setting to play sound when default device changes

	TODO:
	- make hotkey menu show toggle device
	- make sound on device change configurable
